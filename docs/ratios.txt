For MF, T/F, FI , it gives out : 90, 135, 180, depending on Diff, from Easy to Hard

For SM : 54 sec, 70.2 sec, 97.2 sec, from Easy to Hard.

As easily noticed, numbers are not rounded : ideally, there should be a function that normalizes the result to a multiple of 5. 
Care to round it up properly: if its, for example 97.2 => 95.
